%we will solve the equation Au=b
%create my matrix A
A = zeros(81,81);
for k =1:81
    A(k,k)=4; %leading diagonal values are 4
end
for k=1:80

    %all values are -1
end
for k=1:80

    %all values are -1
end
for k=10:81

%create matrix b of our solutions
b = zeros(81,0); %empty matrix 81 x 1
for k=73:81 %for the nodes P(9,1) to P(9,9), these are the only nodes
    % that will have a solution that isn't 0
    % as it's affected by top boundary where u = 100sin(pi*x/100)
    % all other nodes the temperatures we know is when u = 0

    b(k,1)=100*sin((pi*k)/100);

%now to plot the temperature distribution graph
x = zeros(9,9); %create empty 9 x9 vector where we wll store steady 
%state temperatures for each node
for i=1:9 %for each node in row
    for j=1:9 %for each node in column
        x(i,j)=u(j+(i-1)*(9)); %let the corresponding temperature of each node
        %in u, be placed in the x matrix at certain point
    end

[i,j]=meshgrid(1:1:9,1:1:9); %create x and y axis, 1-9
[c,h]=contourf(i,j,x); %create temp dist graph using contours
